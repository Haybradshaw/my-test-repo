I could ramble on for pages with his professional accolades, but I am not going to do that. Nicholas is well-known as a highly skilled JavaScript developer and author, and he needs no introduction. However, I would like to offer some personal thoughts before praising the contents of this book.</p><p>My relationship with Nicholas comes from years of studying his books, reading his blog posts, watching him speak, and monitoring his Twitter updates as a JavaScript pupil. We first met in person when I asked him to speak at a jQuery conference several years ago. He treated the jQuery community to a high-quality talk, and since then, we have spoken publicly and privately over the Internet. In that time, I have come to admire him as more than just a leader and developer in the JavaScript community. His words are always gracious and thoughtful, his demeanor always kind.</p><p>His intent as a developer, speaker, and author is always to help, to educate, and to improve. When he speaks, you should listen, not just because he is a JavaScript expert, but because his character rises above his professional status.</p><p>This book’s title and introduction make Nicholas’s intentions clear: he has written it to help class-minded (that is, C++ or Java) programmers transition to a language without classes. In the book, he explains how encapsulation, aggregation, inheritance, and polymorphism can be accomplished when writing JavaScript. This is the ideal text to bring a knowledgeable programmer into the fold of object-oriented JavaScript development. If you are reading this book as a developer from another language, you are about to be treated to a concise and skillfully worded JavaScript book.</p><p>However, this book also stands to serve programmers coming from within the JavaScript fold. Many JavaScript developers have only an ECMAScript 3 (ES3) understanding of objects, and they are in need of a proper introduction to ECMAScript 5 (ES5) object features. This book can serve as that introduction, bridging a knowledge gap between ES3 objects and ES5 objects.</p><p>Now, you might be thinking, “Big deal. Several books have included chapters or notes on the additions to JavaScript found in ES5.” Well, that is true. However, I believe this to be the only book written to date that focuses on the nature of objects by giving ES5 objects first-class citizenship in the entire narrative. This book brings a cohesive introduction to not only ES5 objects, but also the bits of ES3 that you need to grok while learning many of the new additions found in ES5.</p><p>As an author myself, I strongly believe this is the one book, given its focus on object-oriented principles and ES5 object updates, that needed to be written as we await ES6 updates to scripting environments.</p><p>Cody Lindley (<span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.codylindley.com" target="_top">www.codylindley.com</a></em></span>)</p><p>Author of <span class="emphasis"><em>JavaScript Enlightenment</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>DOM Enlightenment</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>jQuery Enlightenment</em></span></p><p>Boise, Idaho</p><p>December 16, 2013</p></section></body></html>
